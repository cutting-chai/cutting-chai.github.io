<p style="text-align:center">
The 10th edition of our festival, CC-X, as we affectionately called it that year, commenced on February 8, 2017 and concluded on February 10. The tenth year turned out to be a milestone, with a record breaking year of fun, city-wide participation and overwhelming emotions.
<br><br>
We revolved around the theme of World of Magic this year, the edition titled ‘Chai of the Mystics’. Our contingents enchanted our campus with their magical vibes, from Voldemort to Genie, from Darth Vader to Melisandre, they all raced for the Spectre.
<br><br>
This year too, we had quite a few big names in the industry visiting us, including Divya Khosla Kumar Tanmay Bhat, Rajesh Kumar, Kiku Sharda, Sushant Divikar,Kavita Seth, Amplifier Band, Rithvik Dhanjani, Chintan Ruparel, Frhad Samji, Makrand Despande and Vikrant Massey. We were also honoured to host the promotion of Himansh Kohli and Manjari Phadnis starrer ‘Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai’.

Jai Hind College, disguised as the contingent ‘Genie’ won the war of witches and wizards eventually, and took the trophy home.

excerpt: The Story of Cutting Chai
---

<p>
  A new year, a new kettle, the same aromatic tea. That’s exactly what makes Cutting Chai special. We are what we are, one of the biggest media festivals in Mumbai. What more are we? A big family, riding on a wild roller coaster, spiralling into 3 days of insane fun and memories, to be concise.
</p>
<p>
  What’s on the stove? More than 20 colleges from all over Mumbai participating in numerous media related events, a great amount of a healthy competitive spirit, comradery and a learning experience like no other, with a dollop of unforgettable memories and a just a tiny pinch of excitement, wait, whoops, we dropped a whole pack in here, our bad! Brew it well for a perfect recipe of Cutting Chai.

<p>
  What have we seen? The crème de la crème of Bollywood, gracing our auditorium with their presence, the brightest talents of the budding media fraternity from all over Mumbai and most of all, a thousand emotions, all amalgamated into what goes by the name of this wild city’s favourite beverage, Cutting Chai.

 The Chai keeps getting better with each passing year, with each batch adding in their own ingredients, their own personal touch. 11 years on, not once has the chai stepped back, and with the only aim of turning better than it ever was, has gracefully slid into the new decade, the 12th year.

<p>
  Our Mantra is simple. The more we try to make a better tea, the more are chances we cry over split milk. Why try, when its all in the head, exploding with creativity from all ends, excellence is what results.

  It's brewing, slowly.

            		<p>While writing the book ‘Once Upon a Chai’, the author ended it with a riddle or rather a message which predicted the Dooms day &amp; evil approaching. </p>

            	<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
            		<p>Due to an uncertain disaster, the book burned down and reached hell, it came in the hands of the Angel of Death (Azrael) who then delivered the message to the gatekeeper of purgatory.</p>
            		<p>The message read, “The world is in danger. The protectors are dead. Revive the deadliest!”</p>
            	</div>
            	<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
            		<p>After reading this, the gatekeeper grants an opportunity to those souls to purify themselves and do the good they couldn’t, by overcoming all the obstacles, levels and fighting to be the one in order to win the elixir of life and relive to accomplish the unfinished business.</p>
